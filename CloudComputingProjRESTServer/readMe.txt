This is the simple structure of the REST Server.
It's just one-night work, may not be complete and correct. 

We probably need to revise the structure during the implementation.

Here is the list of libraries we need:
---------
javax.ws.rs-api-2.0.jar
jersey 2.0 library
---------

There resource I got writing the framework:

http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-aj-tomcat/#download	(WARNING: This example applied jersey 1.x for implementation, which is outdated)
https://jersey.java.net/

Hopefully, the framework helps
